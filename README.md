## Features
* Run in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* Run as standalone [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) app
* Supports [local](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40007244/655296) or [remote Docker API](https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-enable-docker-remote-api-on-docker-host-7b73bd3278c6)
* Fully configurable
  * Configure multiple Docker hosts
  * Disable / enable many aspect of the discovery
  * Supports config-file or environment variables configuration
* REST API
* Receive Docker [events](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/events/)
  * Through [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)
  * Through [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/)
* Start / stop Docker containers
* [HomeAssistant MQTT discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/) compatible
* Docker container attributes available as entity attributes in HomeAssistant.

## Installation

__TODO__

### Docker

```bash
docker run......
```

### Docker compose

```yaml
version: "3.8"
```

## Configuration

You can either configure the app using an [edn](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) file,
or by specifying environment variables.

### Multi-value properties

__EDN__: Keyword-values inside a `set`, ex.: `#{:mqtt :rest}`

__Environment properties__: Comma-separated string-value, ex.: `"mqtt,rest"`

### Properties
See the server [README](./server/README.md)

## Security

To enable `basic authentication` on the REST and WebSocket endpoints, set the
`http.username` and `http.password` properties. If you don't need the REST API,
I recommend disabling it by omitting it from the `docker.exposure` property.

### SSL

Docker Discovery doesn't provide a built-in solution for HTTPS or WSS. I recommend
placing something like Nginx in front to provide that functionality. I can recommend
[Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) üëç With that you can also handle
authentication (`basic auth`) in the proxy manager instead, it gives more flexibility.

## MQTT

Set the MQTT username and password properties if your broker requires authentication.

### HomeAssistant

When enabled, Docker Discovery will publish HomeAssistant supported messages to MQTT.

Each Docker host will become a `device` and the containers will become `switches` for that respective device.

The switches will have some container attributes available on the `entity`.

## WebSockets

You can find the websocket api [here](doc/websocket-api.md).

## Future plans

### Functional enhancements

* Make more of the features configurable.
* More Docker information available through REST API, without duplicating the original Docker API.
* Handle more Docker events.
* Support other MQTT platforms than HomeAssistant (?)
* Create a custom HomeAssistant integration making use of the WebSockets event. This will be a separate repo of course.
* Create a custom HomeAssistant Lovelace card displaying more of the Docker container attributes etc. Also a separate repo.

### Technical improvements

* Use [component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) to manage application lifecycle.
* Use [reitit](https://github.com/metosin/reitit) as router.
